# Personal Website
Here's the repository for my static personal website that I use to keep track of all the projects that I have created over the years. These projects span my over 7+ years of work now which includes high school projects developed at the start of my tenth grade, all the way up to my final year university capstone project. The website was developed using HTML/CSS.
